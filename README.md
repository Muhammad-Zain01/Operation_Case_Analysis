### Project Overview 
#### What is FICO Score?
FICO, originally Fair, Isaac and Company, is a data analytics company based in San Jose, California, focused on credit scoring services.
#### What is Payoff Loans?
Payoff Loans are the loans usually take to pay existing credit card Debt, and make monthly installement payment to pay off.
### Recomendations:
I have some data driven recommendations are as follows:
- we should develop an automated calling system call on an Hourly or Half-day basis, so we can remind our customers more consistently
- In the Data, people with less than an Annual Income of $70,000 are more likely to be charge-off, so while dealing with those customers, we should have some limit, so they do not charge off.
- If we created some strict obligatory factors, for charge-off customers It will also help us to retain customers
